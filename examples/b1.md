# North American Beaver (Castor canadensis)

## Overview

The North American beaver is a large, semi-aquatic rodent native to North America. Known as a keystone species, beavers play a crucial role in creating and maintaining wetland ecosystems through their dam-building activities and feeding habits.

## Physical Characteristics

### Size and Weight
- Adult beavers typically measure 3-4 feet in length, including their tail
- Weight ranges from 35-65 pounds, with some individuals reaching up to 100 pounds
- Females are generally as large as or larger than males

### Distinctive Features
- Large, flat tail measuring 8-12 inches long
- Webbed hind feet for swimming
- Sharp, continuously growing orange-colored incisor teeth
- Dense, waterproof fur ranging from light brown to black
- Special transparent eyelids that allow them to see underwater
- Closeable nostrils and ears for submerged swimming

## Habitat and Behavior

### Dam Construction
Beavers are famous for their dam-building behavior, which serves multiple purposes:
- Creates deep-water pools for protection from predators
- Ensures underwater access to their lodges
- Facilitates easier transport of building materials and food
- Provides safe storage for winter food supplies

### Lodge Architecture
Beaver lodges are complex structures that typically include:
- Multiple underwater entrances for safety
- A main chamber above water level
- Ventilation holes near the top
- Separate areas for feeding and sleeping
- Annual maintenance and improvements before winter

## Ecological Impact

### Positive Effects
1. Wetland Creation
   - Dams create diverse wetland habitats
   - Support numerous plant and animal species
   - Improve water quality through natural filtration
   - Help prevent flooding and drought

2. Ecosystem Services
   - Sediment capture and stream flow regulation
   - Groundwater recharge
   - Carbon sequestration
   - Stream temperature moderation

### Management Considerations
1. Conflict Areas
   - Flooding of human infrastructure
   - Tree removal in managed landscapes
   - Agricultural land impacts

2. Solutions
   - Flow devices to manage water levels
   - Tree protection in sensitive areas
   - Relocation programs where appropriate

## Diet and Feeding Habits

### Primary Food Sources
Beavers are herbivorous, with a diet consisting of:
- Tree bark (especially aspen, willow, and cottonwood)
- Aquatic plants
- Leaves and twigs
- Cambium layer of trees
- Various shrubs and herbs

### Seasonal Variations
- Spring/Summer: Fresh vegetation, aquatic plants
- Fall: Increased woody material consumption
- Winter: Stored branches and twigs from food cache

## Social Structure and Reproduction

### Family Groups
- Live in family units called colonies
- Typically consist of an adult pair and their offspring
- Young remain with parents for up to two years
- Territorial behavior toward other beaver families

### Reproduction
- Breeding season: January-March
- Gestation period: 100-120 days
- Average litter size: 2-4 kits
- Sexual maturity: 2-3 years of age
- Monogamous pairing for life

## Conservation Status

### Historical Context
- Nearly extinct in 1800s due to fur trade
- Successful restoration efforts throughout 1900s
- Current population estimated at 10-15 million in North America

### Modern Challenges
- Habitat fragmentation
- Urban development
- Climate change impacts
- Human-wildlife conflict
